## Files changed / created during the recent integration

- frontend/src/context/UserContext.tsx (NEW)
  - Purpose: Provide `currentEmployeeId` and setter across the app. Syncs with localStorage for persistence. Used by `HeaderBar` and `EmployeeInfoPanel` to reflect dev-selected employee immediately.

- frontend/src/components/ChatInput.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Accept user input, parse structured commands (e.g., `show efficiency trend EMP-001`), call analytics services for `EMP-`, `PROC-`, and `DEP-` identifiers, and fall back to AI mock in `ai.ts`.
  - Key behaviors:
    - No-op on empty input.
    - Pushes a pending AI message to allow UI to show "AI is thinking..." state.
    - On successful analytics call, constructs a deterministic visualization descriptor matching VisualizationRegistry keys and passes it to the parent.
    - Emits clear error messages when requested entity not found.

- frontend/src/components/AiOutputPanel.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Render AI output text and structured visualizations. Validate descriptors with `visualizationValidator` and sanitize descriptor.data (strip `title`, `label` fields) before handing to `AnalyticsView`.

- frontend/src/components/AnalyticsView.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Accept `visualizationKey` + `data` and render the chart component mapped to the key. Chart heading/title uses the static label from `VisualizationRegistry` rather than AI-provided titles.

- frontend/src/components/ChatHistory.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Controlled rendering of messages. Auto-scrolls to the latest message, shows pending AI message with 'italic/animate-pulse' style, supports Export (Markdown) and Clear actions. Messages persisted to `localStorage` with cap 500.

- frontend/src/components/HeaderBar.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Top bar with dev controls. Now reads/writes `currentEmployeeId` via `UserContext` for immediate UI reflection.

- frontend/src/components/EmployeeInfoPanel.tsx (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Shows tickets and employee analytics for the selected `currentEmployeeId` from `UserContext`.

- frontend/src/services/ai.ts (NEW/UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Deterministic AI mock that returns text and structured visualization descriptors. Used locally until real AI backend is integrated.

- frontend/scripts/smokeTests.js (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Node smoke test that exercises create/accept/hito/kpis and analytics flows. Auto-creates missing procedure data to avoid 404s.

- frontend/src/services/auth.ts (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Dev auth helper functions (loginDev, logoutDev), dev token storage, and helpers to set/get dev employee id (migration path to JWT later).

- frontend/src/config/VisualizationRegistry.ts (UPDATED)
  - Purpose: Template registry mapping keys to visualization templates (label, requiredFields, description). Ensures UI uses canonical labels.

- frontend/src/utils/visualizationValidator.ts (NEW)
  - Purpose: Validate that visualization descriptor data contains required fields before rendering. Prevents charts from rendering on incomplete data.


## Notable implementation notes and rationale

- Chart Title Authority
  - Chart titles are sourced from `VisualizationRegistry` (`template.label`). AI-provided `title` or `label` in descriptor.data is deliberately stripped by `AiOutputPanel` to avoid UI jitter where the last AI message overwrote chart titles.

- Local dev auth vs production JWT
  - For speed of iteration we added a dev-login route and a small frontend auth shim. The next session should replace this with proper JWT/session handling mapped to `employeeId`.

- Command parsing in `ChatInput`
  - Supports shorthand commands that identify employees or procedures and uses typed services to build visualization descriptors. This keeps the UX deterministic and testable.

- Persistence & Size Cap
  - Chat messages saved to `localStorage` under `ai_chat_messages`. Cap set at 500 messages to avoid unbounded growth.


## Tests & Verification

- TypeScript checks: `npx -y tsc --noEmit` executed in the frontend workspace; last run exit code 0 (no blocking type errors).
- Smoke script: Updated to handle missing `PROC-001`; user-run smoke tests completed successfully (health OK, ticket lifecycle outputs, analytics keys present).


## Known issues / Deferred work

- Replace dev auth with JWT and server-side userâ†’employee mapping (priority for production).
- Consider adding a confirmation modal for Clear chat (low risk) and an undo flow for clears.
- Add unit tests for visualizationValidator and mapping logic in `ai.ts`.
- Remove/clean up large/legacy files in `garbage/` folder.


## File map quick reference (important types & services)

- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - axios instance with baseURL `http://localhost:3000` and JSON headers.
- `frontend/src/services/tickets.ts` - wrappers for `/api/tickets` endpoints.
- `frontend/src/services/employees.ts` - wrappers for `/api/empleados`.
- `frontend/src/services/procedures.ts` - wrappers for `/api/procedimientos`.
- `frontend/src/services/analytics.ts` - wrappers for `/api/analytics/*` endpoints.


## Next actionable items (for next session)

1. Implement backend JWT issuance & verification and an `/api/auth/me` endpoint returning the mapped `employeeId`.
2. Update frontend `auth.ts` and axios interceptors to include tokens and fetch current `employeeId` on app load into `UserContext`.
3. Add unit tests for `visualizationValidator` and critical services.
4. Add a confirmation modal for clearing chat history.
